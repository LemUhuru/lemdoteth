# Hi and Welcome, I'm Lem Uhuru. 

A born and raised NYC dev from Queens who recently moved to Miami, FL with his wife and 1 year old daughter to escape the cold winters but is now missing out on all of the great NYC food options :(, it's okay, his doordash bill is now manageable and his wife is an excellent chef, hehe :).


As a developer, he loves using technology to make his life more efficient and if possible, earn some coins to escape the rat race (hasn't made it out yet). Check out some of the sick ass apps he constructed and actually uses daily to write essays, manage personal finances, and track work performance.
